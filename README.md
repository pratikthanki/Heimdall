## Carbon Intensity

With the growing need to understand and address the use of natural energy sources, 
this app aims to show a snapshot of current usage across the UK by regions as well 
as forecasts for the next 48 hours.

You can build the app locally, by running:

```sh

# for linux based systems you will need execute permissions on the file
chmod +x ci/build-app.sh

# run the script to build an image and run as a container
ci/build-app.sh

```

Visit the app at - `http://localhost:5000`
